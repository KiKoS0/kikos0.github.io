# About Me
---
Hi, my name is Daghmoura Riadh and i spend half my time passionately learning to be a better
developer and getting my hands dirty trying new technologies and the other half attending
lectures, listening to boring stuff and complaining about how bad they are taught.

I'm interested in web development (mostly backend stuff), DevOps, computer graphics, reverse engineering 
software and a lot of other stuff.

I'm currently in the middle of my university studies at [ISSATSO](http://www.issatso.rnu.tn/) and looking for
an end of studies internship/project of couple months (4-6) starting from Feb-2021, so if you want to contact me you 
can find me:
- By sending me an [email](mailto:dag.riadh@gmail.com)
- Private message me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riadh-daghmoura-043077185/)

And despite not being a real direct communication channel you can also find me on: 
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9437824/kikos)
- [Github](https://github.com/KiKoS0)

Yes, my online nickname is KiKoS.
