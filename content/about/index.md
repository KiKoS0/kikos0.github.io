# About Me

---
I am Riadh Daghmoura, a software engineer from Tunisia who loves writing simple code and appreciates those who do as well. I currently work at [@Candidate.ly](https://candidate.ly).

I graduated from [ISSATSO](http://www.issatso.rnu.tn/) with a degree in software engineering a few years ago.
I am interested in web development (mainly backend, though I’ve been doing a lot of frontend recently), DevOps, computer graphics, reverse engineering, and much more.

If you want to get in touch with me, you may find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riadh-daghmoura-043077185/)
or send me an [email](mailto:dag.riadh@gmail.com)

I'm also on:
* [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9437824/kikos)
* [Github](https://github.com/KiKoS0)

In this blog, I share the most interesting experiences I’ve had as a software engineer that I’m able to discuss.

Yes, I go by the online nickname KiKoS, in case you come across it somewhere.
