# About Me
---
Hi, my name is Daghmoura Riadh and I spend an awful lot of time developing and breaking things in order to improve as a developer.

I'm interested in web development (mostly backend), DevOps, computer graphics, reverse engineering and a lot of other stuff.

I'm a freshly graduated software engineer from [ISSATSO](http://www.issatso.rnu.tn/) who is looking for new opportunities.
So, if you want to get in touch with me, you may find me on:
- [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riadh-daghmoura-043077185/)
- By sending me an [email](mailto:dag.riadh@gmail.com)

Also, I'm on: 
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9437824/kikos)
- [Github](https://github.com/KiKoS0)

Yes, my online nickname is KiKoS.
