# Personal projects

---
There are tons of toy/incomplete/prototype projects on my [github](https://github.com/KiKoS0/) so feel free to check 
them out, those are the only ones I felt inclined to discuss and/or document:
* [Dead by Daylight Tooltips](https://dbdtwitch.com) — Twitch addon that improves the viewer's experience by presenting game information right in the stream.
It is currently used by thousands of streamers and averages 400K+ unique visitor a day. It is built with [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org) combined with OpenCV and Tensorflow workers, all running on a tiny [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) cluster.
* [Ray Tracer](https://github.com/KiKoS0/ray-tracer) — a toy implementation that supports [wasm](https://webassembly.org/) 
of a realtime renderer in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
* [PE cryptor](https://github.com/KiKoS0/Portable-Executable-Encryptor) — a library that encrypts a compiled
[Portable Executable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format) file.
